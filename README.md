# Bio 232

code/analysis for bio 232 @ Northwestern

`lps_bargraph.R` contains commented code that can be used to make a bar graph from the day 2 plate reader data. This can be downloaded (by clicking on them then clicking the download icon) and added into your own project.

Note that when reading in your own data, you may need to adjust the filename/path for your data, as well as the columns/rows of the excel sheet to read. You can start by downloading the example data as well if that helps, but the data you use at the end of the day should be your own.
